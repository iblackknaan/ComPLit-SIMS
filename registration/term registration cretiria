That's a good point. Retaining data for the failed class while recording the repeated class as a retake ensures that there's a clear record of the student's academic history. Here's how we can incorporate that into the process:

Retrieve Existing Student Data: Pull up the information of existing students from the database, including their current class, academic year, and any other relevant details.

Promotion Check: Evaluate each student's performance to determine if they meet the criteria for promotion to the next class. This could involve checking their grades, exam results, or any other performance indicators.

Promotion Process:

If the student meets the promotion criteria, update their class and academic year accordingly in the database.
If the student needs to repeat a class, move them back to the previous class but retain the data of the failed class for reference purposes. Mark the repeated class as a retake.
Repetition Process: Move students who need to repeat a class back to the previous class. Retain the data of the failed class for reference purposes. Mark the repeated class as a retake.

Termly Registration: Record the registration details for the new term, including the class, academic year, and any other relevant information.

Additional Information: Manage any additional information related to the termly registration process, such as enrollment dates, registration fees, or special requests from students.

Confirmation: Confirm the termly registration with the students and update their records in the database.

This way, the student's academic history is accurately reflected in the database, showing both the failed class and the retaken class. Does this approach align with what you had in mind?
