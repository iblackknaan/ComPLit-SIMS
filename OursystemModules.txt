### Implementation Plan Overview

Each module will be developed in phases, ensuring that the core functionalities are prioritized and additional features are iteratively added. The implementation phases could be structured as follows:

1. **Phase 1: Planning and Requirement Gathering**
   - Finalize requirements and specifications for each module.
   - Design the system architecture.

2. **Phase 2: System Design and Development**
   - Develop the core modules (User Authentication, Student Management, Teacher Management).
   - Set up the database and initial data migration.

3. **Phase 3: Testing and Quality Assurance**
   - Conduct thorough testing of developed modules.
   - Implement user feedback mechanisms.

4. **Phase 4: Deployment and Training**
   - Deploy the system to a staging environment.
   - Conduct training sessions for end-users (teachers, admins, students, parents).

5. **Phase 5: Go-Live and Support**
   - Deploy the system to the live environment.
   - Provide ongoing support and maintenance.

6. **Phase 6: Continuous Improvement**
   - Collect user feedback and perform regular updates.
   - Integrate advanced features and emerging technologies.

By following this modular approach, the school management system can be effectively developed, deployed, and continuously improved to meet the evolving needs of Kisa Nursery and Primary School.
